Three solid years of coding and I am still learning. I am still learning to best the best version of myself and to be the best software engineer I can ever be. Helping and build products are the core of what I enjoy doing. I am full of thank and grace for how much I was able to achieve in 2020. Moving and settling in Osogbo, working with Natterbase, meeting new people, learning new things, building new products and writing more. I am grateful for the year 2020.

I met a lot of awesome folks this year ranging from day to day co-workers to
community leaders and mentors. Learnt that your net-worth is a true reflection
of your network. [Ama](https://twitter.com/amakha__) - Star girl👩🏼‍🎤🌟,

From the [last year review](https://www.oluwasetemi.dev/2018-the-review/)
podcasting is my thing. I love listening to them on commute to and from work,
when doing house chores, any opportunity that would not so require my full
attention was dedicated to listening to podcast majorly Tech related. One faith
based podcast I love listening to is
[Ask Pastor John Piper - ASK PJ](https://www.desiringgod.org/ask-pastor-john)
and [Quote of the day by Sean Croxton](https://quoteofthedayshow.libsyn.com/)
for motivation.
