I hope this was going to be my note for the conference but I failed. Taking
notes during conferences is very crucial when ever you attend a conference. To
keep the journey and sequence of event during the conference. Keep track of
talking points during the conference. Creating a document that others who
attended or did not attend will get to read as summary about the important
highlights of the conference.

Small things I failed on but I try to not fail too often.
