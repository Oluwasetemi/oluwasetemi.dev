# Introductory Guide to ES2021

Keeping up with programming language updates can be demanding. JavaScript's
ubiquitous nature is a reason the language is experiencing very consistent,
fast, and frequent updates.

The Ecma International's TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers, implementers,
academics, and more, collaborating with the community to maintain and evolve the
definition of JavaScript. They are doing an amazing job of keeping the language
in the good shape. I appreciates the effort and do hope you do as well.

I will do a review of ES2021 (ECMAScript 2021) updates to the language.Show some
of the syntax where appropriate with examples.

## Prerequisites

You are expected to have a good understanding of JavaScript or Nodejs. If you
are willing to keep up with the latest updates to the language then this is a
best fit for you.

## String.prototype.replaceAll

JavaScript language does not have a way to replace all of the occurence of a
string value without the regular expression hack using global flag or a loop
combined with `String.prototype.replace`.

```javascript
// regex approach
let str = "my name is ojo";
str.replace(/\s/g, "#");
// 'my#name#is#ojo'

// loop approach
while (/\s/g.test(str)) {
  str = str.replace(" ", "#");
  // 'my#name#is#ojo'
}
```

This introduce the `String.prototype.replaceAll()` to the language which is
widely available in modern browsers. Check here for
[compatibility with old browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_string_replaceall).
[Check here for nodejs support](https://node.green/#ES2021). Support for this in
nodejs starts from version 15.14.0.

You can polyfill with
[es-shims](https://github.com/es-shims/String.prototype.replaceAll),
[corejs](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#stringreplaceall).

> A polyfill is a function utility that can make the new features work in legacy
> browsers just by putting the polyfill code in your code. Polyfills gives you
> access to the features while they might not be ready in modern browsers.

```javascript
let str = "my name is ojo";
str.replaceAll(" ", "#");
```

## Promise.any

Developers find it hard to make promises return the first occurence of a
resolved or rejected promise, `Promise.any` proposes a solution to handle this
use-case. It introduces something called Aggregate errors - Errors grouped in
Array. Nodejs support for this feature starts from the version 15.14.0, while
the browser support is implemented in all major browsers. Consider the following
code snippet.

```javascript
const promises = [
  fetch("/endpoint-a").then(() => "a"),
  fetch("/endpoint-b").then(() => "b"),
  fetch("/endpoint-c").then(() => "c"),
];

try {
  const first = await Promise.any(promises);
  // Any of the promises was fulfilled.
  console.log(first);
  // → e.g. 'b'
} catch (error) {
  // All of the promises were rejected.
  console.assert(error instanceof AggregateError);
  // Log the rejection values:
  console.log(error.errors);
  // → [
  //     <TypeError: Failed to fetch /endpoint-a>,
  //     <TypeError: Failed to fetch /endpoint-b>,
  //     <TypeError: Failed to fetch /endpoint-c>
  //   ]
}
```

## Numeric Separators

Numeric separators give more options for how numbers are formatted with
separators. This proposal merges underscore separator proposal with numeric
literal separator which allow a character separator between digits.Support for
numeric separators in nodejs start in version 12.8.1 and all the major browsers
support this proposal.

It comprises of Number literals support for Decimals and Binary, Hex, Octal,
BigInt literal support. Let consider the following examples.

```javascript
let num = 1_000_000;
console.log(num);
```

## WeakRefs and Logical Assignments Operators

The WeakRef proposal solve the two problem of

- creating weak references to objects with the WeakRef class.
- running user-defined finalizers after objects are garbage-collected, with the
  FinalizationRegistry class.

Support in nodejs start from the version 14.18.0 and all major browsers support
this proposal.

Logical Assignments Operators on the other hand combines the assignment operator
and the logical operators together. Just the way we can combine the assignment
operator with mathematical operators in `+=, -=, *=, /=`. We now can have the
following operators `||=, &&=, ??=` which is "Or Or Equals" (or, the Mallet
operator), "And And Equal", "QQ Equals" respectively. Instead of doing
`a || (a = b)` which interprets to a or b is assigned a, you can now `a ||= b`.
Consider the following code snippet for the `&&=` and `??=` usecases.

```javascript
// "And And Equals"
a &&= b;
a && (a = b); // if a is true then assign b to a
if (a) {
  a = b;
}

// "Or Or Equals"
a ||= b;
a || (a = b); // if a is false then assign b to a

// "QQ Equals"
a ??= b;
a ?? (a = b); // if a is null or undefined then assign b to a
```

They are called the logical or assignment, logical and assignment and logical
null coalescing operators. Nodejs support starts from 15.14.0 and are supported
by all the major browsers. They have three main features:

- basic support
- short-circuiting behaviour
- setter not unecessarily invoked

## Conclusion

The updates are not much but the changes ES2020 brings solves a number of
problem. It brings elegance to the way we write code, get to do more with less
code.
