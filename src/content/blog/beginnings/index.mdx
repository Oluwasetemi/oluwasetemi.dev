A very difficult part of life is the beginning, full of waiting. 9 month for a
new baby and numerous days/months/year for fruits.

Harmattan is showing up on this side of the world and it signifies a new season,
the season of thanksgiving. The season of christmas and chickens. The time to
boil water for to take your bath. The transition in coloration of the
vegetation.

It took me a lot twist and turns to set this blog up and I must keep my to
promise of showing up from the
[first post](https://oluwasetemi.github.io/hello-word).

If you don't know, this blog was built with [Gatsbyjs](https://gatsbyjs.org).
It's gradually gaining ground with it's ideology of [React](https://reactjs.org)
and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) like I mention in the
[first post](https://oluwasetemi.github.io/hello-world), PWA ingrained and other
cools feature that are pre-baked. I used the
[Blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and tweaked with
[overreacted](https://overreacted.io/) - A personal blog by
[Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov).

I am sure I will enjoy the new opportunity to write this blog and I can only
hope it will be needful to everyone like me out there in the cold, tech savvy ,
computer science folks and all with interest in learning how to code.

Remember you are never alone. Enjoy the new opportunity to be world class in the
voice of
[unicodeveloper - Prosper Otemuyiwa](https://mobile.twitter.com/unicodeveloper)
by embracing a New Beginning - a leap to greatness.
