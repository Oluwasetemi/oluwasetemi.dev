Before I answer this, let me put some things into a clear perspective. _I am not
a super genius kid who got access to a computer before their teenage age, nor am
I a knowledgeable person with a bright IQ rating_.

I am a developer with over five years of experience writing codes and three
years as a software engineer. I started as a self-taught (not **self-made**) in
programming basics. It means I got a fundamental understanding of programming
concepts from watching a video, reading a blog post, or attempting to read a
programming textbook I never completed. I did some form of low-grade boot camp
after the semester, which was usual at the university I attended. I studied
computer science, which, in the context of my situation, did not teach practical
programming basics. I learned a lot here and there. I have written code with the
following programming languages: Pascal, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript,
Python, and Nodejs. I am only proficient in JavaScript and its type variant.

I will highlight four things that worked for me based on my situation and
learning conditions. Stumbled on a course titled **Learning How to Learn**
changed the dynamics of my being and gave me the confidence to learn anything I
desired. I learned **Discipline and Motivation** while serving in my Christian
fellowship during my undergraduate program at Ladoke Akintola University of
Technology. Finding the **best resources** that work for me is a strategy I
gleaned from learning how to learn a course I took from Coursera. **Practicing
or Building stuff** from what you learned like your life depends on it was a cue
I picked from two books.

## Learning How To Learn

Learning how to write code is a lifelong journey; it involves grasping the
concepts of deconstruction and recombination of Knowledge. It requires having
the superpower of figuring things out, a childlike wonder. A child will always
wonder about everything and want to know the mystery behind the operations of
anything they encounter. This lifelong commitment to learning is a testament to
the patience and dedication required in the tech field.

It is the courage to take on a piece of information and distill it until you can
reproduce it in several formats. Addy Osmani talks about learning in his
[Software engineering soft parts](https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/)
and [Shawn Swyx Wang](https://learninpublic.org/) also put great emphasis on
this in the last chapter - The Operating System of You. He linked to
[Max's Two Cent article on learning how to learn](https://max2c.com/learning-how-to-learn/),
which also linked to a
[great material](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) I
recommend to everyone I am actively mentoring.

It is a **first principle** thing to grasp the concept of learning; it will be
helpful in your coding career and help you in every phase of life.

## Motivation and Discipline

I left this only at motivation, and a brilliant student added discipline after
reviewing for me, which is worth mentioning. I do what I do because I love it; I
do it passionately, and it does not feel like work. I could do it with a reward
and much effort because it is natural. This emphasis on discipline and
motivation should inspire you to stay determined and focused on your tech
journey.

It would help if you generated motivation for this subject when trying to learn
this coding career. Whether money, sapa (hunger or poverty), or economic
hardship in our part of the world. The discipline is to continue even when you
feel not good enough or do not see the impact of your learning. That means you
should not give up; you will improve at writing code.

Living a purpose-driven life will always be a source of drive and a profound
reason for your WHY. It reminds me of books like START WITH WHY by Simon Sinek,
Drive by David Pink, and the famous Atomic Habits by James Clear.

## Searching For The Best Resources

Naval - A very successful, famous Silicon Valley investor shares his opinion
that - if you are the best mathematics teacher in the world, then you should be
teaching the world mathematics. To get so good at this coding career, you must
look for the best resources with good explanations and a high bar for
excellence. This advice should empower you to seek out the best resources and
take control of your learning journey.

The JavaScript community has a lot of high-profile Engineers who are great
educators and produce quality content to show new concepts. Read code writing by
industry experts. Use web apps and software created by these gifted hands who
bless the world with their skill and content to help improve others.

A notable example is the famous [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), who
is unmatched in quality content production in the web development space focusing
some of his teaching courses on React with a course named
[Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) which is planned for the 1st quarter
of 2023, the famous [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/)
which is a paid content, [his blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) ozes quality
with the illustrative teaching approach. Some people will say the situation in
the country makes it hard to pay for courses in foreign valuation. I would argue
you could get some great material for free, just like
[JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info). Other notable high-bar courses are
the [Testing JavaScript Course](https://testingjavascript.com/) and
[Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) by the famous Kent C Dodds.
[Matt Pocock Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/) is another
excellent content. [Build UI](https://buildui.com/),
[Frontend Fresh](https://frontendfresh.com) by Hassan Djirdeh, Vue School and
Vue Mastery are great examples. Some documentation is enough, and some
frameworks have an example folder showing how to implement basic things. Getting
quality content will take a lot of research and talking to experienced people
about what you are trying to learn.

A final destination for high-quality content is **Open Source**, Contributing
and looking through the codebase on GitHub will expose you to how `mad` some
people can write fantastic software. The world is more open than ever. That
reminds me, we are in the [hacktoberfest season](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
You contribute to open source and get fantastic gift items.

## Practice - 10000 hours or 10000 Iterations

[Malcom Gladwell](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/), who is one of my favorite
writers of all time, says we need 10000 hours to master a craft in his book
**Outliers** but I have often found out that what you do during those 10000
hours will determine what you will be. If you watch and read without practicing
code for those 10000 hours, you will be a guru in what you have consumed. You
will end up in a tutorial hell cycle and will eventually be unable to build a
Todo app.

Even though we cannot rule out time to help us understand and become that sound
software engineer, there is often more. The kind of problems you are exposed to
will determine what you can do. The number of iterations of complex situations
you can solve will be your badge of honor. Don't ever run from big and daring
problems solve them in iterations over and over until you can solve them in your
sleep. Building solutions is your job as an engineer, so the earlier you start
practicing and building, the better you will become. Whether it is hours or
iterations, keep solving problems and building small examples that will become
your portfolio when looking for a job.

Never disregard the challenges you are facing or will face while trying to
become a software engineer in whatever clime you may be learning from, embrace
each of them. It is a making process. **REAL GOLD FEAR NO FIRE**. I expect what
you will make out of your journey. You are brilliant and unique in all shades.
Keep pushing and never give up.
