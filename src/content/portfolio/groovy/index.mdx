# Groovy Nightlife App

The problem I was solving with this solution is an App to manage people&apos;s
night life including solutions for varying level of user who will manage the
night-life from inventory to each order placed. I worked on the backend with
Typescript and the newly shinning prisma orm in a REST api setup which uses
swagger-ui for documentation. The developer experience was smooth.

## My Role on the Project

- Worked collaboratively with a mobile developer and a project manager.
- I designed and implemented the database (prisma, mongodb).
- Designed and Implemented communication with external API (paystack,
  flutterwave).
- I architected and implemented the backend (typescript, nodejs, rest api).
- I used GitHub Actions to handle the CI and CD.
- I handled the DevOps tasks. (AWS, Linux).
- Documentation was done with swagger-ui

## Motivation

This was a contract gig where I was brought on by the project manager, The
developer experience DX was the silver linning for me during the project. Using
prisma orm with typescript made everything type safe. Prisma data modelling was
very smooth compared with mongoose modelling of data which I use for some of my
project in the past.
