# cova

It was to be an insurance platform which makes buy and selling of insurance
policy automated. The backend is a traditional backend project which implement
the storage layer with mongoose orm and mongodb. The payment side of the app was
done with paystack. The mobile and web layer will consume the REST api.

## My Role on the Project

- Worked with a 4 man team
- I designed and implemented the database (mongodb).
- Designed Implemented communication with external API (leadway and Paystack).
- I architected and implemented the backend (nodejs, rest api, express).
- I used Gitlab runner to handle the CI and CD.
- I handled the devOps tasks. (AWS, Linux).
- Documentation was done with Postman.
- Had meeting with client and stakeholder.

## Motivation

My first project where I was the sole developer on the backend. Had good
communication with the frontend engineer which made my work smooth. The design
and the management aspect of the project were drawbacks.
