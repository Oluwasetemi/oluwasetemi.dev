# API.OLUWASETEMI.DEV

A personal API repository that serves as a comprehensive backend solution with modern development practices. The platform features structured logging with Pino, type-safe routes documented with OpenAPI, interactive API documentation via Scalar, and a GraphQL endpoint powered by Drizzle GraphQL and Apollo Server.

## Key Features

- **Structured Logging**: Implemented with Pino and Hono-Pino for comprehensive request/response logging
- **Type-Safe API**: All routes are documented and type-safe using @hono/zod-openapi with Zod validation
- **Interactive Documentation**: Self-hosted API documentation using Scalar for seamless developer experience
- **GraphQL Endpoint**: Full GraphQL API powered by Drizzle GraphQL and Apollo Server
- **Database Management**: Single source of truth database schemas with Drizzle ORM and SQLite
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with Vitest and proper test organization
- **Modern Development**: ESLint configuration with @antfu/eslint-config for consistent code quality


## My Role on the Project

- **Full-Stack Development**: Designed and implemented the entire API architecture from scratch
- **Database Design**: Created and maintained database schemas using Drizzle ORM with proper migrations
- **API Documentation**: Implemented comprehensive OpenAPI documentation with interactive Scalar interface
- **GraphQL Integration**: Set up and configured Apollo Server with Drizzle GraphQL for flexible data querying
- **Testing Strategy**: Established comprehensive testing patterns with Vitest and proper test organization
- **DevOps & Deployment**: Configured deployment pipeline and hosted the API at api.oluwasetemi.dev
- **Code Quality**: Implemented ESLint configuration and maintained high code standards

## Technical Architecture

The API is built with a modern, type-safe architecture:

- **Framework**: Hono.js for high-performance web framework
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation and OpenAPI documentation
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Server integration with Drizzle GraphQL for flexible data access
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Pino for production-ready monitoring
- **Testing**: Vitest for fast, comprehensive testing with proper test organization
- **Deployment**: Deployed on a VPS with Caddy as a reverse proxy.

## Motivation

This project was motivated by the need for a personal API that demonstrates modern backend development practices. It serves as both a practical tool for personal projects and a showcase of current best practices in API development, including type safety, comprehensive documentation, and developer experience considerations.

The API is publicly available at [api.oluwasetemi.dev](https://api.oluwasetemi.dev) with interactive documentation at [api.oluwasetemi.dev/reference](https://api.oluwasetemi.dev/reference). The graphql endpoint is available at [api.oluwasetemi.dev/graphql](https://api.oluwasetemi.dev/graphql).
