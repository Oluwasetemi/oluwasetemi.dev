      About Me
      <span role="img" aria-label="a man">üë®</span>
    </h2>

    <p>
      I'm Oluwasetemi
      <span role="img" aria-label="nigerian flag">üá≥üá¨</span>, my name is pronounced SHAY + TAY(Not TI) + ME. People often
      call me Ojo, Temi, Setemi or Stephen. I prefer to be addressed with anyone that is easy for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a web developer, passionate about the stuffs I build from Nigeria
      <span role="img" aria-label="nigerian flag">üá≥üá¨</span>
      who loves to work with JavaScript, Typescript Reactjs, Nodejs and GraphQL. I love to solve problems compared to focusing
      of the technology howbeit, I consider what technology is best fits the domain of problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I teach programming and web development related courses to entry level developers. I focus on all the stuffs that
      will make the difference and make learning interesting. I have a special way of making complex concept simple and
      easy to grasp.
    </p>

    <h3>More on Family</h3>
    <p>
      I am the second of 6 children and the first male in the lineage. Both parent are late (Blessed memory), Mum died
      first year in university and Dad died while I was serving(as a graduate in nigeria it is mandatory to serve the
      nation for a year which involves paramilitary training and other community services) Nigeria (country of birth) in
      Benue State (Food basket of the nation), Nigeria in 2017.

      I build software with JavaScript and Typescript confidently. I have good experience with C# and Python (Flask,
      Django). I have written a little bit of C and C++ (not near production experience trust me, educational purpose).

      piece), Nextjs, Prisma, Keystone, CMS - Contentful, Sanity. For more technical details like uses, fonts, setup and
