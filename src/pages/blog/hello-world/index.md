Everything in this community begins with `Hello, World` and I am excited to
start this blog. I will tell a small story of who I am, what I do.

The goal is to show up regularly here at least once in a week.

I love JavaScript and believe the next two big things in web
development might be [React](https://reactjs.org) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

I leave with these quotes:

> If you are a professional make your promise and keep it.
>
> Trust and attention are the two building blocks of the modern economy.
