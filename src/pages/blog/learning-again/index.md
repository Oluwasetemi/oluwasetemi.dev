2020 was a wonderful year with mixed feeling, not sure I will be able to release my year review as fast as I noprmally would do cos this year is a different one. The Joy mixed with axiety and hope and despair the whole world is currenlty going through and its impact on life. I choose to be happy and live live to the best putting to use all my abilities.

Got married 2020 December like I promised Rufus after he told me December was a good time to tie the knot. He got married 8th December 2018 if I am right. I picked 26th December and did not tell many people. Its a decision I took carefully with my best friend and considering our families and close associates.

Well after the whole event and move into our new apartment in the subhord of the town of Osogbo, resuming my Job after we took a break over a project December 18th. To resume back to learning becamee a very difficult job. I was almost mentally exhasted. The stress from planning for the event - I hope I can one day write a comprehensive planning guide to how my wife and I planned ours and what we learnt. Back to the drip - Chaos and fear of whether I would still be able to write code after all I have not written a line of code in days now.

The fear of survival after the whole event now running a new family is not a small job coupled with existing responsibilities I have always faced as mine - my duty.

I was hospitalized to mention after the event. Had malaria and the normal drugs I use were not working so I had to visit the hopital for treatment. Anyways I am doing wonderfully well now and I getting up to speed back with wiritng code again. BS its so much fun to write code (software).

Once again I finding joy in what has brought me this far LEARNING. This is why this career path is what it is. You have to stay relevant by putting the work to learn and work hard with the ever changing field of software development,

I have a new office to my self between which has really helped me settle in back to work. Not sharing with anyone like I was when I lived with a cousin when I just moved to osogbo. I hope no matter what you're facing or passing thruough you will find joy in doing the work you promised to do and much more never stop learning and investing in yourself. It is this investment in ourselves that will bring to the top of our career or lead us to creating a path worthy of following,

I will be writing about what I am learning regularly now. its a commitment. Currently learning python with a friend. I am reading the documentation of hub a git based utility that give you github super powers. I am still very much inteerested in writing bash shell scripts to make work more easier. I want to do more frintend work this year too. Do more with what I have learnt wiht GraphQL.
