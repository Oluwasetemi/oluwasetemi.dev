<!-- # TalentQL Pipeline Frontend Test -->

A frontend interview test which I did when I applied for the TalentQL pipeline
program for the frontend tract. The problem statement is to build a grid app
that renders items from a json file. The items would be filtered by shapes and
colors. All items would be selected by default, and the grid title should
reflect the active filters.

## My Role on the Project

- I built everything.
- I designed and implemented the frontend logic (reactjs, typescript).
- Step up static test, unit test, integration and e2e test
  (@testing-library/react, cypress).
- I run a validate script on every git commit (husky, lintstaged).
- I used GitHub Actions to handle the CI and CD to run the test on every push
  and pull request.
- Styling done with styled-components (Styled Components)
- Static testing was done for types, lint and formatting, styles (Typescript,
  Eslint, Prettier, Stylelint).
- Used React context api to manage the fake authentication.
- Used Redux to manage the state (Redux Toolkit).
- implementation with specific task as assigned and necessary.
- Maintaining a code coverage of 90% for branches, 80% for functions, 90% for
  lines and 90% for statements.
- I used vitejs to create the starter file with the react-ts template.

## Motivation

I was trying to move from a backend major dev to frontend so I need to do more
frontend related projects. I wanted to become a generalist developer who can
comfortably work on both side of the stack. Applying for the pipeline program to
be mentored was all the push to get this done. The timeline was 7 days but I
have then add more features gradually to the App. I have learnt a lot trying to
write clean code with this project. I have written some articles from some of
the problems I encountered while working on this project.
