<!-- # Bejamas -->

The platform runs a graphql backend built with hasura, the data layer uses a
postgres. The frontend is built with Nextjs and it uses Apollo Clinet for state
management, and fetching data from the graphQL backend. The Technology stack is
awesome and much more the platform is built to meeet optimal performace, web
core vitals and met the need of the users.

## My Role on the Project

- Worked on it alone.
- I designed and implemented the database (hasura, postgres, heroku).
- I used GitHub Actions to handle the CI and CD.
- I handled hosting on netlify.
- Contributed to the frontend (Nextjs, Apollo Client, Emotion)
- Implemnted the UI design from the figma file

## Motivation

Building an ecommerce prototype to experiment with modern web building tools
like Nextjs, Hasura, GraphQL.I ensure the ESlint, prettier and Stylelint and
TypeScript were all used to lint the codebase. I wrote test for unit,
integration and end to end with cypress and setup CI/CD pipeline to run the test
on push or pull request updates. Measuring the web core vitals was key for both
mobile and web. Ensured that the web core vital was 80+ in rating. Features like
sorting, filtering and add to cart was implemented.
