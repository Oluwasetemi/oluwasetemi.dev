# zeedas

The platform is a proposed solution to build a software development management
tool, that is a REST api backend built with nodejs. It uses mongodb for storing
data.

## My Role on the Project

- Assigned Task by the Team Lead and Project manager.
- I designed and implemented a search feature which uses the mongodb text search
  feature.

## Motivation

This was the first project I worked on as a junior developer. I only attended
team briefs, product meetings, design implementation briefs, show and tell
briefs. I was moved on to another project. The codebase was poorly structured it
does not have any documentation for all its api, I had less joy working on the
project.
