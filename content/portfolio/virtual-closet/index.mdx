# Virtual Closet

A solution to manage users closet which is built with nodejs and graphql for the
backend and the data layer is mongoose + mongodb. The frontend is built with
Nextjs using Apollo Client for data management. The Backend powers the mobile
application built with React Native and the platform is managed using the admin
interface. The solution was built to solve the problem of wardrobe(closets)
management hence, it offers the users a virtual closet and help with laundry
management.

## My Role on the Project

- Lead a team of 3 developer, 1 designers, and 1 project managers.
- I designed and implemented the database (mongodb).
- Designed and Implemented communication with external API (stripe and calendar
  api).
- I architected and implemented the backend (nodejs, graphql, apollo-server).
- I used GitHub Actions to handle the CI and CD.
- I handled the DevOps tasks. (AWS, Linux).
- Co-work on the frontend (Nextjs, Redux, Styled Components, Material UI)

## Motivation

The problem statement was clear and interesting, building a solution for this
problem taught me a lot. It is one of the best project I have worked on till
date. Working with the mobile developer to implement the GraphQL solution.
