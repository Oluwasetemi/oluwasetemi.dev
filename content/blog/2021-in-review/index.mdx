Moving into 2021, January for me was settling into a new identity of a new
realization of becoming a married man - Its one of the most daunting
responsibility I have ever faced. Not sure of what is in there, I am definitely
settling well into the new identity.


Missed the first month of working due to illness and stress of the last year. I
had project I was working on as a contractor. Worked on a couple of projects
from backend to frontend. I worked on my website and gave blogging(writing)
another try.

Joined a mentoring program from TalentQL was the highlight of my year, meeting
with great mentors who are working at top companies in our industry. Closed the
year with someone interning with me and training some newbies to become software
developers with JavaScript and Python as the main languages.

## Watching NBA games

I have a new habit of watching NBA games started with following Golden State
warriors game. Watched the pre-season games of the warriors starting with a 6 -
0 wins in 6 games. The whole warriors team has been playing fantastic through
out the regular season. I sure hope they will make it to the playoffs and win
the western conference championship.

Stephen Curry broke the all time 3 PT record in the NBA. I am sure he will set
another record in 3 point shooting that will be difficult to catchup with. Klay
Thomphson is still out injured and I am sure he will be back in the NBA
January 2022. James Wiseman has been out all season as well. Both players have
not had the chance to play together in an NBA game which is something I honestly
look forward to.

Jordan Poole has been a great revelation this new year and Andrew Wiggens is
have his best season as an NBA player.

## Joining a new company 2022

I will be joining a new company as a fullstack engineer as a contractor with
TalentQL facilitating this new opportunity. The role will involve working with
GraphQL using AWS Amplify and React.js (TypeScript) for the frontend. I will be
working on a couple of Python scripts to help with analytics.

I hope to enjoy the new challenge and much more become a better software
engineer and get the chance to work on my AWS certifications as a solutions
architect.

I look foward to helping the company achieve its goals, learn from my team
members and develop a great team culture.
