Such a huge year with opportunity to prove myself as a software developer.
Plenty goals, few were crushed and others I failed at. Plenty learning and
lessons, plenty positives to take to the new year and focus on the thing I said
was going to do during my last year review and evaluation of my journey.I
enjoyed every bit of it and I am excited about what the future holds in faith
now.

One goal was to write code and get to build products(software) useful and
usable. Put all the learning over the year into practice. All the effort of the
past years and learning put them together and use more. This is my third year of
coding fully as a professional and my fifth year of involvement in Tech. I am
very pleased and happy to be able to share my learning with the hope to help
me👦🏼 become better each new day.

Babajide and the FCMB team for the great community full of impact most
especially the world class idea of
[Epic hours](https://www.fcmb.com/hub-one/event.php?a=epic-hour-at-hub-one).

My Intern - [Ayokanmi Dammy](https://github.com/dammieayokanmi)'s progress is
glowing, mastering the art of frontend engineering during her compulsory 6 month
internship under my watch. We were privilleged to work on some project's
together. You did so well my sister from another mother. Keep the progress.
Don't despise the days of little beginning. Your progress map is amazing.

![Speaking at JAMstack Lagos](https://res.cloudinary.com/drnqdd87d/image/upload/v1581767571/Personal/IMG_20190502_072957.jpg)

Meet with someone I so much admire in the Nigerian Tech Space, the one and only
🔥minister, the God of [@unicodeveloper](https://twitter.com/unicodeveloper),
the Chief himself - Prosper Otemuyiwa at the 1st edition of the
[JAMStack meetup](https://www.meetup.com/JAMStack-Lagos/) organized by
[Williams Imoh](https://twitter.com/iChuloo/) and
[Gift Egwuenu](https://www.twitter.com/lauragift21/). He was impressed with my
presentation during the meetup and we did some PHP dev bashing. Trust me none
can say anything not too cool against PHP where Prosper is - I was on the
receiving end. He was so much fun and I hope I get to know him better. He is
doing so much work o the community with for loop Africa and his new company

Such a wonderful story December 2018 as I resigned from my then current
engagement in Ibadan after a massive training project in òwò, ondo state,
Nigeria where young secondary school student were taught how to code from
scratch via a support initiate that my then employer (Mayokun) were charged with
the resposibility to handle. I was not sure of where I would be working next but
I waited and prepared. Rufus Oyemade did a
[tweet shoutout](https://twitter.com/Oluwarufus/status/1078564443636809729?s=20)
for me and boom I got an offer to resume January.

## Relocating to Lagos

From the tweet that happened 28th December to resuming 8th January, 2019. The
Journey down to lagos packing and getting a prime opportunity to reunite with my
big sister in her place in Lagos pending when I was okay to move to my own
apartment. Move to lagos in the early part of the year and started living with
my big sister. I ❤️ Travelling and travelled a lot during the year especially to
Ibadan and Osogbo. Went to Abuja fewer times compared to last year. Attended
some of my friends wedding ceremony as well.Met with
[Faith Dike](https://twitter.com/faithiedike) from this
[tweet](https://twitter.com/faithiedike/status/1078681217984278530?s=20).

## Failures

I was sloppy at times this year yet I knew I just wanted an atmosphere to learn.
I failed a lot of times. Just wanting everthing to go smoothly as planned using
Todo List and Routines. Did not want to take up fixing legacy codebase with
unrealistic timeline and pressure which was very important to my company due to
certain reasons. Fixing buggy codebase with poor understanding of the project is
an unrealistic effort when I first joined my new team but I had to man up and
face the fear at certain points. I failed at starting a podcast.I failed an
Andela interview at the 3rd stage. Plenty rejections from Call for papers to
speak at conferences and workshop. Personal development dragged, wrote less
react code, struggled with writing automated tests, CI and CD setup and Nodejs
design patterns.

## Evolution

The year saw a lot of revolution in the tech space both local and international.
Largest tech conference happened in Nigeria and Kenya via
[concatenate conf](https://link) and I attended the last day and missed out on
the workshops.

I saw myself at different level during my time at natterbase. I want to improve
and be the best I can ever be as a JavaScript developer. I want to work on more
larger codebase and with good agency with good engineering structure and more
projects and better project managers.

I love graphQL and hope to start the Lagos meetup for graphQL soon. I convinced
my team to try it out for a project and I will write about our experience and
what we learnt. I love everything that has to do with netlify, Apollo,
Codesandbox, Paypal and one day hope I will work with one of these company.
Andela is another dream place I hope to work. After Ibrahim joined and he told
me about all the wonderful structures in their setup and system put in place to
make developers productive.

I hope to write more TypeScript all year in 2020. Get to learn and master
another programming language. Thinking ELixir or Erlang. I must be better with
C# and Java with the `plenty🧘🏼‍♂️` I know.

The goal for next year is to build ton of product like
[Sara Vieira](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW)
[conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KauRmlffjqc) on building shit
ton of project and ideas. Do more open contribution. Really do not know what to
expect but I am sure I will give every thing I have within me to become better
than I was in 2019. Another thing to focus on is building progression with my
routine (finding consistency and good habit formation). Speak to my mentors and
write more.

### The book I read in 2019

Could not read as I would have loved since normal day to day work was very
choking and I was just learning to manage day to day work as a software
development.

### Podcast I listened to

From the [last year review](https://www.oluwasetemi.dev/2018-the-review/)
podcasting is my thing. I love listening to them on commute to and from work,
when doing house chores, any opportunity that would not so require my full
attention was dedicated to listening to podcast majorly Tech related. One faith
based podcast I love listening to is
[Ask Pastor John Piper - ASK PJ](https://www.desiringgod.org/ask-pastor-john)
and [Quote of the day by Sean Croxton](https://quoteofthedayshow.libsyn.com/)

### Desire to work remotely

The hustling and bustling of lagos has made me to desire to work remotely. I
believe I could do better with my time management if I get an opportunity to
avoid commuting. It requires lot discipline and focus. The Cost here in Nigeria
is hgh considering that you will be paying for data and electricity yourself and
be the one to manage power outage with either an inverter or a generating set.
Went to stay with one of my Aunties - Mummy Jasmine and her place offered me lot
of comfort to work remotely which I tried a couple of times. The battery of my
laptop cannot go long hours but I managed to get a brand new MacBook Pro 2019
Corei5 1.4ghz towards the end of the year. It was huge but I hope it will spur
my career trajectory forward.

### Teaching and the developer advocate in me

Somehow I am asking a lot of questions about what I want, my just cause or
purpose in all this coding and working. I have strong desires to live to the
maximum of my God given potentials and abilities with hard work and consistency.
But I stumble when I try to come to resolve of what I want from my own life. I
took some weeks off towards the end of the year away from people to just
thinking about the outlook I want my life to have. Coming to a resolve that I
want to teach more JavaScript related and bring to public the part of me that
like to explain thing to other developers, the part of me that jump on exciting
technology and teach it to new engineering team to make their live and work more
easy. The part of me that writes too - the kind of article I search for to find
on the internet. I hope 2020 will be me doing more of teaching and advocating.

### The plan for 2020

Silently all over this blog post I written and talked about all the thing I hope
to focus on this new year.
